Here is the ToDoApp I developed with Android Studio.

I have jused Java as the programming language and sqlLite database for the storage purposes.

Here I learned how a mobile application works and its functionalities while exploring the basic fundamentals of Android Studio.

It also enhaced my ability in coding Java. 

This project helped me a lot  as the first step in my mobile application development carrier.

I recommend anyone watching this start up with this type of application if you want to learn the basics of any platform and languages.
